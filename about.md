Actually, I am a Machine Learning engineer @ [OpenBee](https://www.openbee.com){:target="_blank"}  where I'am leading an R&D Team. My main works focus on how to improve multiple tasks related to [DMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system){:target="_blank"} (document management system) like OCR, documents classification, barcode recognition, document tracking, etc using AI (machine learning and deep learning) and blockchain (Ethereum and IOTA) technologies.

Also, I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the **RISC** Lab (Robotique, Informatique et Systèmes Complexes) at the national engineering school of Tunis, Tunisia. My research focus on how to apply and use Machine Learning and Deep Learning on [Steganography](/2018/Introduction-Steganography/){:target="_blank"} and [Steganalysis](/2018/Introduction-Steganalysis/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of networks, computer science, and machine learning to areas like self-driving car, health, and steganalysis where we can really engineer better solutions for helping and protecting peoples.
