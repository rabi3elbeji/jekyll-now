<h4>  2. Book Description </h4>

<ul>

 In the last decade, with the major advance of deep learning models, we have seen many new powerful steganography and steganalysis techniques based on several deep learning models reported in the literature. This book focuses on reviewing the general concepts of the most recent steganography and steganalysis techniques based on deep learning models. You'll start with the key principles of Steganography andSteganalysis to build a solid foundation, before covering neural network architectures and understanding how they work rather than how they applied them for steganography and steganalysis.  you'll get a comparative study between recent approaches of steganography and steganalysis. You will then discover how powerful the neural network models are in revolutionizing the universal StegoSystems. Finally, you will get a futuristic view of many applications of steganography and steganalysis in cybersecurity, military and many other fields and how they can be useful and dangerous for the digital world at the same time.
