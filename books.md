> Author: Rabii Elbeji

 The book generally describes the evolution of StegoSystems over the past decade. It is made up of the following 5 chapters:

 - Chapter 1 entitled `Introduction to stegosystems in the digital domain`: This chapter presents the compositions and characteristics of digital stegosystems in the digital domain. Also the different use cases in detail and their impact in several areas of society.

 - Chapter 2 entitled `Steganography and Machine Learning`: This chapter presents in detail the various relevant studies in Steganography using Machine Learning as well as a comparative study of these studies according to several scientific criteria and metrics.

 - Chapter 3 entitled `Steganalysis and Machine Learning`: This chapter is similar in structure to the second chapter but the study this time was devoted to approaches to steganalysis.

 - Chapter 3 entitled `Advantages and disadvantages of using deep learning in stegosystemes`: The chapter follows the evolution of steganography and steganalysis approaches based on the different deep learning models and mentions their added value during the last decade. The Chapter also attacks the weak point of these models.

 - Chapter 5 entitled `Towards Universal Stereo Systems with AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)`: A futuristic vision of the impact of the evolution of AI on stegosystems and their impact on data privacy.
