> Understanding steganography and steganalysis with a broad coverage of the state of the art of deep learning models with a futuristic vision of the next generation of StegoSystems in the era of AGI.

<h4>  1. Key Features </h4>

<ul>
<li> Gain a fundamental understanding of Steganography and Steganalysis in the digital domain.</li>

<li> Cover recent articles that use deep learning models for Steganography and Steganalysis such as convolutional neural network
 (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN).</li>

<li> Get a futuristic vision of steganography and steganalysis applications in several fields with the advancement of deep learning and the artificial general intelligence (AGI).</li>
</ul>

<h4>  2. Book Description </h4>

<ul>

 In the last decade, with the major advance of deep learning models, we have seen many new powerful steganography and steganalysis techniques based on several deep learning models reported in the literature. This book focuses on reviewing the general concepts of the most recent steganography and steganalysis techniques based on deep learning models. You'll start with the key principles of Steganography andSteganalysis to build a solid foundation, before covering neural network architectures and understanding how they work rather than how they applied them for steganography and steganalysis.  you'll get a comparative study between recent approaches of steganography and steganalysis. You will then discover how powerful the neural network models are in revolutionizing the universal StegoSystems. Finally, you will get a futuristic view of many applications of steganography and steganalysis in cybersecurity, military and many other fields and how they can be useful and dangerous for the digital world at the same time.

 </ul>

 <h4> 3. What this book is for  </h4>

<ul>

 This book is for steganography and steganalysis scientists, cybersecurity scientists, computer vision professionals, image processing professionals, machine learning engineers and AI developers who have some knowledge of machine learning and deep learning and want to build expert-level StegoSystems applications.

</ul>
