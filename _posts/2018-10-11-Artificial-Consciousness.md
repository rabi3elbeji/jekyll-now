## Question ?

**Is it possible to artificially model human consciousness one day?**

It is almost impossible to find an exact and clear definition of consciousness. What really exists are several subjective philosophical definitions.


The subjectivity of consciousness is due to the fact that the definition is closely related to the individualized experiences and intelligence of each human being, as well as to several other temporal and spatial factors of existence.


Despite the difficulty of defining this subjective concept, let us at least agree that it exists.

The level of consciousness of the human being varies according to these experiences and its biological intelligence. This invisible intelligence comes from a brain made up of billions of neuronal connections and complex and fairly precise chemical reactions.

Until this highly advanced era, we are unable to understand in detail how our biological brain creates intelligence.

Despite this complexity of the biological brain's construction, we begin to emulate, step by step, the functioning of the human brain through mathematical models to create what is now called **artificial intelligence**.

The fact that the consciousness of the human being is linked to his intelligence can open the door to the possibility of creating **artificial consciousness** based on artificial intelligence.
